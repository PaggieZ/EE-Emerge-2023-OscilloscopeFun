# Oscilloscope Fun
The goal of this project is to explore the differences between three types of oscilloscopes by displaying images on their screens. We programed a microcontroller to send digital signals to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) which sends the analog signals to each oscilloscope. The project shows improvements of the display resolution and reading precision on modern measuring instruments.

# About the Project:
Pure Analog: The analog signal is directly coupled with the cathode-ray-tube (CRT) for display.

Hybrid: The analog signal is processed by a built in processor and displayed using the CRT.

Pure Digital: The analog signal is converted into a digital signal and displayed on a digital screen.
