# Oscilloscope Fun
A common testing equipment on most electrical engineers’ work benches’ is an oscilloscope which traditionally displays voltage versus time waveforms on a grid. Despite this shared functional principle, each oscilloscope type possesses inherent characteristics that could potentially influence the output images. 

This project explores the various functions and possible variations of images on oscilloscopes through the design, implementation, and evaluation of a 4-bit R-2R Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) to generate images on different types of oscilloscopes. To generate public interest and enthusiasm for oscilloscopes, this project aims to create an interactive experience for users to develop their own images for display on the oscilloscopes.


# Images on Different Oscilloscope

## Pure Digital

The analog input is converted into a digital signal and displayed on a digital screen.

## Hybrid

The analog input is processed by a built in processor and displayed using the CRT.

## Pure Analog

The analog input is directly coupled with the cathode-ray-tube (CRT) for display.
