# Hardware Design
The PCB has an R2R (Resistor-To-Resistor) ladder, we increase the amount of resistors in the R2R to increase the outputs from 4 to 8 Digital-To-Analog Converter (DAC).

We originally had this ladder to have four outputs to have a 4-bit DAC. There we would be able to convert 4 bits of data and display it onto the oscilliscope. First we would connect four output pins from the Arduino to the DAC circuitry. These pins will generate the digital output. The DAC circuitry is resistor ladder network, where each output pin corresponds to a specific voltage level determined by the resistor values. Once we run code through a software to send informtaion to the DAC then to the Arduino, it will generate a changing analog output voltage on the DAC pins, simulating an analog signal with 16 different levels (corresponding to the 4-bit digital values).

Next we went towards the route of changing the 4 bit DAC into an 8 bit system. With an 8-bit DAC, you will require eight output pins on the Arduino instead of four. These pins will be responsible for generating the digital output corresponding to each bit. The Arduino Uno, for example, has a 10-bit PWM resolution, which means it can generate analog-like signals with 1024 different levels (0 to 1023). While this exceeds the 8-bit requirement, it's important to note that not all Arduino boards have the same capabilities. Some may have lower PWM resolution, such as 8 bits (0 to 255), which can limit the precision of the DAC. Once we set up accordingly, we implemented the 8 bit DAC onto a custom made PCB and began to take advantage of the increased resolution and precision in your analog output signals.
